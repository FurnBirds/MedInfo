# Website development. Form page for collecting data.
SET17_FET11 Phase 1 Project

This web page demonstrates the requirements of the Project

The page displays a database of simple patient records. When one of the records is clicked on, on the right their details are displayed. The patient's details can be changed and saved.
New patient records can be created or deleted.
Every time a patient record is saved, the selected record remains and can be continued to be editted.

The web page leverages a local JSON server that needs to be running.
